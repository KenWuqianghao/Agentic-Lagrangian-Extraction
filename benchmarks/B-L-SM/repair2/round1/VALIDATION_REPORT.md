## FeynRules check `hermiticity` output
```
Checking for hermiticity by calculating the Feynman rules contained in L-HC[L].
If the lagrangian is hermitian, then the number of vertices should be zero.
Starting Feynman rule calculation.
Expanding the Lagrangian...
Expanding the indices over 8 cores
Collecting the different structures that enter the vertex.
No vertices found.
0 vertices obtained.
The lagrangian is hermitian.
```

## FeynRules check `kinetic_terms` output
```
Neglecting all terms with more than 2 particles.
Non diagonal kinetic term found: -(ca*sa*del[H, Index[Lorentz, mu]]*del[H2, Index[Lorentz, mu]])
```

## FeynRules check `mass_spectrum` output
```
Neglecting all terms with more than 2 particles.
Non diagonal mass term found: ca*H*H2*muChi2*sa + (ca*H*H2*lambda3BL*sa*vev^2)/2 - ca*H*H2*lambda3BL*vev*xBL + 3*ca*H*H2*lambda2BL*sa*xBL^2
