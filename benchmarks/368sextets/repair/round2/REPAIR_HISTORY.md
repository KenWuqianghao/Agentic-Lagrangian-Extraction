# Repair history — previous attempts on this model

## Attempt 1
What was changed (the agent's own summary):
Changed [model.fr](<benchmarks>/368sextets/repair/round1/model.fr:16) so the NP interaction-order hierarchy is `{{QCD, 1}, {QED, 2}, {NP, 1}}`, avoiding the malformed UFO coupling-order bookkeeping indicated by the `Part::partw`/MadGraph syntax failure, and replaced the final `LSextet = ...` assignment with the required last top-level delayed assignment `LTot := LSextetKin + LFu + LFd + LSu + LSd;`. I left the fields, charges, masses, widths, couplings, and operator terms unchanged.

Validation outcome AFTER that change: status=compiled, hermiticity=True, kinetic=True, mass=True, madgraph_import=False, tags=mg5_import_fail, mg5_python_traceback, mg5_invalid_cmd, compile_seconds=158.8

## For reference — the ORIGINAL model's outcome before any repair:
status=compiled, hermiticity=True, kinetic=True, mass=True, madgraph_import=False, tags=mg5_import_fail, mg5_python_traceback, mg5_invalid_cmd, compile_seconds=159.6
